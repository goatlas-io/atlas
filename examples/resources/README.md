# Examples

## downstream-cluster.yaml

This is an example of how a downstream cluster is represented to Atlas in the Kubernetes cluster.

**Pro-Tip:** You can use the atlas binary and the `cluster-add` command to generate this for you.

## internal-downstream-sidecar.yaml

This is here purely for an example and reference only! This is generated 100% based on the annotations specified on the service definition that represents the downstream cluster.
